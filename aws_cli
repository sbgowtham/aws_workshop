1. Download & Install the AWS CLI on Windows
Download the Installer

Go to the AWS CLI official download page (scroll to the Windows installer section). https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
Choose the correct installer for your system (64-bit or 32-bit).
Run the Installer 

Double-click the downloaded .msi file.
Follow the on-screen instructions (accept the license, choose install location, etc.).
After installation, close the installer.
Verify Installation

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

>>aws --version

You should see something like:

aws-cli/2.12.0 Python/3.11.4 Windows/10 ...

If you see a version number, the AWS CLI is successfully installed.
Alternative: If you have Python installed, you can also install AWS CLI with pip install awscli, but the .msi is often simpler on Windows.


Obtain AWS Credentials

Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
Open the IAM service.
Create or retrieve an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for your IAM user (with the appropriate permissions).
Run 

>>aws configure

In Command Prompt or PowerShell, type:

>>aws configure

You’ll be prompted for:
AWS Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key
Default Region Name (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2)
Default Output Format (e.g., json)
Confirm Configuration

The credentials are stored in two files under C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\:
credentials (Access key and Secret key)
config (Region, output format)
Test the AWS CLI

For example, list all your S3 buckets:
>>aws s3 ls
If it shows your buckets, you’re all set!
